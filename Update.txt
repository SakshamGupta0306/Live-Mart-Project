Project Summary: Live MART – Hyper-local E-Commerce System
We are building a 3-tier e-commerce platform using Java Spring Boot (Backend) and React (Frontend). The system connects Customers, Retailers, and Wholesalers, enabling real-time inventory management, order tracking, and B2B restocking.
1. Tech Stack
Backend: Spring Boot 3.3.5, Java 21, MySQL, Spring Security (PermitAll), JavaMailSender.
Frontend: React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Lucide Icons.
Database: MySQL (Entities: User, Product, Order, RetailerInventory, WholesaleOrder, Feedback).
2. Completed Features
🟢 Customer Module
Dashboard: Browse nearby shops (Simulated using Haversine Formula), View Products, Sort by Price.
Cart & Checkout: Add/Remove items, Select Payment Mode (Online Card Simulation or Cash on Delivery).
Order Tracking: Receive email notifications for Order Placed, Packed, and Delivered.
Feedback: Rate products (1-5 stars) after delivery.
🔵 Retailer Module
Inventory Management: View current stock.
Order Fulfillment: View incoming customer orders with detailed item breakdown.
Status Updates: Mark orders as PACKED -> DELIVERED (Triggers Email).
B2B Restocking: Request stock from Wholesaler (instead of magical updates).
Feedback View: Read customer reviews for sold products.
🟣 Wholesaler Module
Master Catalog: Add new products to the global system.
Request Management: View pending stock requests from Retailers and Approve them (Auto-updates Retailer inventory).
3. Technical Highlights (For Report/Demo)
Transactional Logic: @Transactional ensures stock is deducted only when an order is successfully placed.
Geolocation Simulation: Uses browser GPS + Haversine math to sort shops by distance.
Async Emails: Uses background threads to send emails without blocking the UI.
RBAC: Role-Based Access Control ensures secure routing.
4. Recent Fixes Applied
Security: Removed hardcoded credentials from Git history; switched to Environment Variables logic (or placeholders).
Frontend: Fixed "Shop Details" showing for Customers in Signup. Fixed "Retailer Order View" not showing items.
Backend: Fixed WholesaleController price/ID errors. Added EmailService for status updates.
5. Remaining Tasks (Optional/Future Scope)
Social Login (Google/Facebook) – Skipped (Complexity).
OTP Auth – Skipped (Cost).
Real Maps API – Skipped (Cost/Credit Card requirement).
